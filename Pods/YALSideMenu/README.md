##Requirements

iOS 7.x / 8.x (see installation instructions)

##Installation

####Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

Simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'YALSideMenu'
```

*(CocoaPods v0.36 or later required. See [this blog post](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Pod-Authors-Guide-to-CocoaPods-Frameworks/) for details.)*

####Using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Simply add the following line to your Cartfile:

```ruby
github "yalantis/Side-Menu.iOS"
```

####Manual Installation

> For application targets that do not support embedded frameworks, such as iOS 7, SideMenu can be integrated by including source files from the SideMenu folder directly, optionally wrapping the top-level types into `struct SideMenu` to simulate a namespace. Yes, this sucks.

1. Add SideMenu as a [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by opening the Terminal, `cd`-ing into your top-level project directory, and entering the command `git submodule add https://github.com/yalantis/Side-Menu.iOS.git`
2. Open the `SideMenu` folder, and drag `SideMenu.xcodeproj` into the file navigator of your app project.
3. In Xcode, navigate to the target configuration window by clicking on the blue project icon, and selecting the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.
4. Ensure that the deployment target of `SideMenu.framework` matches that of the application target.
5. In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "Build Phases" panel.
6. Expand the "Target Dependencies" group, and add `SideMenu.framework`.
7. Click on the `+` button at the top left of the panel and select "New Copy Files Phase". Rename this new phase to "Copy Frameworks", set the "Destination" to "Frameworks", and add `SideMenu.framework`.

##Usage

1. Import `SideMenu` module

	```swift
	import SideMenu
	```

2. Adopt the `Menu` protocol in your menu view controller, e.g.

	```swift
	class MyFancyMenuViewController: UIViewController, Menu  {
		@IBOutlet
		var menuItems = [UIView] ()
	```

3. Set `preferredContentSize` to specify the desired menu width
4. Use custom `MenuSegue` to present your menu view controller
